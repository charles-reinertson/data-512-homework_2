# data-512-homework_2

**Goal**

The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. This assignment considers articles on political figures from different countries. I combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of country populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of each article. I also analyze how the coverage of politicians on Wikipedia and the quality of articles about politicians varies among countries. My analysis consists of a series of tables that show:
The countries with the greatest and least coverage of politicians on Wikipedia compared to their population.
The countries with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about politicians.
A ranking of geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.
